This is an open lasertag project of Russian developers

Note: this repository contains an effort to clean up and translate the 3_1 release of this project.

Goals of the project in order of (personal) importance

- Translate source-code comments and documentation from russian into english (90% done)
- Split out LCD message-strings into external file(s) allowing I8N support.
- Provide project documentation (overview, structure, assembly, operation, end-user)
- Check licensing issues of code used (usart, lcd, etc)
- Code-cleanup; coding-style + missing comments
- Provide alternative build-environment for development in full OSS environment
- Rework PCB in OSS-licensed tool (kicad)


The reasons for all of this is that I find that the project as it is seems to have a lively russian development and user-community, but the language-barrier is sure to hinder cooporation fron other people in this field.
The project , because of it's elegance and low cost, has great potential and is surely something that could be valuable to a lot of people looking for an efficient and cheap laser-tag system.
